## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
This project aims to learn functions in C
- How to declare and define them, function prototypes, function call, header files and others
- Nested loops
#### 1. A program that prints `_putchar`, followed by a new line
- file: [`0-putchar.c`](https://github.com/Vulcanric/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/0-putchar.c)
- Only used a user-defined function `_putchar`

#### 2. A fuction that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
- file: [`1-alphabet.c`](https://github.com/Vulcanric/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c)
- Only the user define function `_putchar` is used
