## 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms
**C**		**Algorithms**

This project was done to get prior knowledge of Search Algorithms.

### Search Algorithms
Search Algorithm is one which solves search problems, it is used to retrieve information from a Data Structure.
### Examples:
| Search Algorithms | Info on them |
| ----------------- | ------------ |
| 1. Linear Search | An algorithm that checks each records of a search structure for a target value in a linear manner |
| 2. Binary Search | This algorithm repeatedly targets the middle of a search structure., dividing them until a target value is found |
| ***etc...*** | There are a lot of them |

### More info
- There are files name `n-O` (with 'n' representing a number) in this project containing the ***Space Complexity*** and ***Time Complexity*** of such algorithm. Such as:
	- O(1)
	- O(n)
	- O(n!)
	- etc...
- Every file used a common 
  [`search_algos.h`](https://github.com/Vulcanric/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x1E-search_algorithms/search_algos.h) header file.

***Please note that every code in this project is compliant to the Betty linter.***
